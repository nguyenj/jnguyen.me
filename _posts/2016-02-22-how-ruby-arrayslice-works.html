<p>I've been slowly working through the <a href="http://rubykoans.com">Ruby Koans</a> to sharpen my basic ruby fundamentals and came accross <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-slice">Arrary#slice</a>.</p>
<p>What got me stumped for the first couple of minutes:</p>
<p>[code lang="text"]<br />
array = [:peanut, :butter, :and, :jelly]<br />
assert_equal [], array[4,0]   # =&amp;gt; []<br />
assert_equal nil, array[5,0]  # =&amp;gt; nil<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Initially, I thought both assertions should be <code>nil</code>; however, re-reading the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-slice">Arrary#slice</a> documentation, I've realized I've misunderstood how it worked (<code>ri Array#slice</code> for the command line). The response given on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3568222/array-slicing-in-ruby-looking-for-explanation-for-illogical-behaviour-taken-fr">Stack Overflow</a>, basically says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ...the first number when you slice does not identify the element, but places between elements, in order to be able to define spans (and not elements themselves)
</p></blockquote>
<p>[code lang="text"]<br />
# [ :peanut, :butter, :and, :jelly ]<br />
#  0        1        2     3      4</p>
<p>array[4,0]<br />
# [ :peanut, :butter, :and, :jelly ]<br />
#                                 4<br />
# At index 4 with 0 lengths, hence array[4,0] = []<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>In other words, 4 is still within the array-just at the end of the array in the context of slicing. In the case of <code>array[5,0]</code>, that's just out of range thus we get <code>nil</code>.</p>
