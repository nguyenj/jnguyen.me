<p>All the difference spices and aromas that you can sense from enjoying a bowl of Phở is such an amazing sensation. The thought of preparing this dish myself was intimidating. The taste of the broth overwhelms me with the different spices that I need to acquire as well as knowing how to prepare them. For years, I would just resort to my mother preparing the dish for me or going out to a Phở establishment.</p>
<p>Finally I could not resist in exploring how to prepare this dish myself, my curiosity and patience just got the best of me. I read all I could and phoned mother for all the advice she could give me; but I need to get going on getting those ingredients.</p>
<p>Still slightly intimidated, rather than getting all the spices individually I ended up getting the Phở packets with all the spices already mixed and roasted. All the other ingredients included: Thai basil, cilantro, green onions, sweet onions, ginger, housen sauce, Sriracha, thin rice noodles, thinly sliced flank steak (paper thin), and some beef bones with marrow still attached (ox tail would be good if available in your area).</p>
